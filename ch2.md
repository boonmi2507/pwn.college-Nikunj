# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Arguments
Let's try something more complicated: a command with arguments, which is what we call additional data passed to the command. When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments. Observe:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello
Hello
hacker@dojo:~$
```

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0nrmModnSqyi6gh5x2kAlhikBdT.QX4YjM1wSOwkjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0nrmModnSqyi6gh5x2kAlhikBdT.QX4YjM1wSOwkjNzEzW}

```
